# guavaletters
A fun word game
##setup
clone repo.
run 'gulp build && gulp serve' in command line.

##Purpose
The player is to play all their letters as quickly as possible. All words must connect to another word. The user must use ALL of their letter and the words must pass our dictionary check.

##Known issues
The gh-pages version of the app will not run our internal API. The local version runs fine. We are looking into other hosting options.
